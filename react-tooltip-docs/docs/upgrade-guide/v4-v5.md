# V4 -> V5

If you are using V4 and want to use V5, please read this doc.

## From V4 to V5

V4 was a great react tooltip component but was built a few years ago, he was built with react class components and it's hard to maintain and to the community give contributions, so, with this in mind, we build a new version of react tooltip using [float-ui](https://floating-ui.com/) behind the scenes. This gives a great improvement in performance and in a new and easier code to let the community contribute to the project.

## Improvements

- Dropped package dependency `uuid`
- - Using React `useId` (https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useId)
- - - Unfortunately `useId` was introduced only into React v18, so, that will be the minimum necessary version of React to V5
- Dropped package dependency `prop-types`

## Break Changes

- Default Padding changed from `padding: 8px 21px;` to `padding: 8px 16px;`
- Exported module now is `Tooltip` instead of `ReactTooltip`
- - If you already have a `Tooltip` component in your application and want to explicitly declare this is `ReactTooltip`, just `import { Tooltip as ReactTooltip } from "react-tooltip"`
- CSS import is now optional, so, you can modify and/or add any styling to your floating tooltip element
- `data-tip` attribute now is `data-content`
- `getContent` prop now doesn't accept `any` anymore, just a `function`

## New Props

- [x] classNameArrow
- [x] events - `data-events` -`['hover', 'click']` - default: `['hover']` (always an array when using as prop, even with only one option, when using as data attribute: `data-events="hover click"`)
- [x] isOpen - `boolean` (to control tooltip state) - if not used, internal state of tooltip will handle the show state
- [x] setIsOpen - `function` (to control tooltip state) - if not used, internal state of tooltip will handle the show state
